# Song of Kanye Bot


The first time I read Walt Whitman (embarrassingly late in my literary career), I was like, damn, this sounds like Kanye West!

This twitterbot makes that errant thought a reality and tweets lines of Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself" from Kanye West's perspective (twice daily).

To avoid the threat of duplicate tweets, once a line gets tweeted from the poem, it's deleted from the text file. There are probably more sophisticated ways of handling this problem, but that was the quickest and surest way I could come up with. But I'm definitely open to suggestions, so hit me up.
